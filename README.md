# Voron-Afterburner-Breakout-Board
This is a breakout board for use with the Voron Afterburner toolhead. It reduces the number of wires in the cable chain to 14

You will find a spreadsheet with all the wiring colors and info here as well as a part BOM

gerbers zipped and ready for your favorite pcb manufacturer are here (I used JLCPCB with a matte black silkscreen)

you will need to reprint 2 peices from the clockwork as they include standoffs for the pcb here

Optional: I also modified the chain anchor to add a zip tie for strain relief on the wires

In addition you will need 2 M2x6mm screws. I used machine screws and wouldn't recommend using the standard voron M2 plastic screws as they are too long

I have also uploaded some pictures of the board installed on the toolhead here
